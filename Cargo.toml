# plotters now requires Rust 2021, and criterion uses plotters, so criterion is
# now incompatible with our minimal supported Rust version. We only need tests
# to check compatibility, not benchmarks, so we can resolve this by make the
# criterion dependency optional. Except dev dependencies cannot be optional, so
# we must make criterion a non-dev dependency, which it shouldn't be as it adds
# lots of build overhead. Thus we turn the feature off by default.
